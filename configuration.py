This excitement has died down ever since we reached the moon and our space program has failed to do any exciting launches since. Now with SpaceX talking about going to Mars, the excitement is coming back! But they are missing the same thing that NASA was missing when going to the moon. They forget about everyone on earth and their desire to go into space and explore with the spacecraft. With the Humanity Chip we will be able to capture a digital profile for everyone on Earth and send it up to space and eventually to another planet! This is the most amazing thing in my mind, since technology has reached the point where we can actually do this!
